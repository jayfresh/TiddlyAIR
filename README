I've made a TiddlyWiki that is wrapped up in an Adobe AIR container as 
a standalone app. The original TiddlyWiki still opens in a browser and 
functions normally (although its store is kept separate in the AIR 
app's storage directory). 

Point of this: to try out a TiddlyWiki in a controlled environment 
where "save changes" isn't a big pain. 

Restrictions: cookies don't work yet; import doesn't work yet. I 
haven't looked into these problems though. 

To use: 
- download source 
- install AIR 
- install AIR dev tools
- run client.build 
- install TiddlyAIR.air
